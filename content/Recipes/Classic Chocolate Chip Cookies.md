## Description

The perfect chocolate chip cookie - crispy on the edges, chewy in the middle, and loaded with chocolate chips. This classic recipe never disappoints!

## Ingredients

- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

3. In a large bowl, cream together butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy (about 3 minutes).

4. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla extract.

5. Gradually blend in the flour mixture until just combined.

6. Fold in chocolate chips.

7. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased cookie sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

8. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until edges are golden brown.

9. Cool on baking sheet for 2 minutes, then transfer to wire rack.

## Notes

- For extra chewy cookies, slightly underbake them
- Use a mix of milk and dark chocolate chips for more complex flavor
- Dough can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 3 months
- Try adding 1 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans for a nutty variation
