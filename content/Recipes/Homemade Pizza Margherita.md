## Description

An authentic Italian pizza margherita with homemade dough, fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce, and basil. Simple ingredients, incredible flavor!

## Ingredients

### For the Dough:
- 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 envelope instant dry yeast
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 1/2 cups warm water (110°F)
- 2 tbsp olive oil

### For the Topping:
- 1 cup tomato sauce (preferably San Marzano)
- 8 oz fresh mozzarella, sliced
- Fresh basil leaves
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt to taste

## Instructions

### Make the Dough:

1. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, yeast, and salt.

2. Add warm water and olive oil. Mix until a sticky dough forms.

3. Knead on a floured surface for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.

4. Place in an oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise for 1-2 hours until doubled in size.

### Prepare the Pizza:

5. Preheat oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven.

6. Divide dough into 2 balls. On a floured surface, stretch each ball into a 12-inch circle.

7. Spread tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border.

8. Arrange mozzarella slices on top.

9. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt.

10. Bake for 10-12 minutes until crust is golden and cheese is bubbly.

11. Top with fresh basil leaves immediately after removing from oven.

## Notes

- For best results, use a pizza stone or steel
- The dough can be made ahead and refrigerated overnight for better flavor
- Don't overload with toppings - less is more with margherita pizza
- Fresh mozzarella will release water, so drain it well before using
