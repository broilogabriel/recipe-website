## Description

A quick and delicious pasta with fresh tomato sauce. Perfect for busy weeknights when you want something satisfying and homemade.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb spaghetti or your favorite pasta
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can (28 oz) whole peeled tomatoes (or 2 lbs fresh tomatoes, chopped)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)
- Fresh basil leaves
- Grated Parmesan cheese for serving
- Extra virgin olive oil for drizzling

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil for the pasta.

2. While water heats, make the sauce: Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat.

3. Add minced garlic and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant (don't let it brown).

4. Add tomatoes (crush them with your hands as you add them if using whole). Add salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes if using.

5. Simmer sauce for 15-20 minutes, breaking up tomatoes with a spoon, until slightly thickened.

6. Meanwhile, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta water before draining.

7. Add drained pasta to the sauce. Toss to coat, adding pasta water as needed to achieve desired consistency.

8. Tear fresh basil leaves and stir into pasta.

9. Serve immediately with grated Parmesan and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.

## Notes

- Use San Marzano tomatoes for the best flavor
- Don't overcook the garlic - it can become bitter
- Save that pasta water! It helps the sauce cling to the pasta
- Add a splash of pasta water to leftovers when reheating
- Try adding anchovies with the garlic for umami depth
